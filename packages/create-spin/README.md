## Usage

To use Create Spin App, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm (Node Package Manager)** installed on your machine.

To create a new application using Create Spin App, you can run the following command:

```shell
npx create-spin-app@latest
```

- This will launch the CLI and prompt you to choose a template for your application. Simply select the desired template and follow the instructions to generate your new application.

- `create spin` runs in interactive mode by default, but it also provides the option to specify **additional templates from a remote repository** by passing the URL

   ```shell
   npx create-spin-app@latest -- --additional-template https://github.com/mdn/html-examples
   ```

## Design

**Í©ú Spin is a common platform for developing, delivering and hosting frontends.**

### Templates / Starter kits

- Create Spin App provides a set of templates that are designed to enhance the developer experience (DX) by providing a ready-to-use project structure with essential configurations.

- By leveraging these templates, developers can quickly set up their projects with **essential tools and configurations**, allowing them to focus on building their applications.

[Check out the full list](../../examples) of example templates, available on GitHub.
